# gba-sp-headphone-jack
 A list of headphone jack mods for the Game Boy Advance SP.
 
 There's a few options to choose. None are perfectly ideal IMO - there isn't a lot of space to fit the headphone jack. Consider the pros and cons of each before committing - remember to consider ergonomics and where you hands will usually rest.

## Under power LEDs
Might affect ergonomics! I personally have [no issue](under-power-LED-ergonomics.jpg).
