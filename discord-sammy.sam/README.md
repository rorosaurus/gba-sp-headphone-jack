# I found a dumb place to put a headphone jack on the SP

If anyone has done that before or seen it done, let me know, I’m still not 100% about the final install

Like I guess epoxy the hinge barrel to the main body frame and let the top half hinge around that

I’m concerned I might not have the play necessary to get the top half back onto it though

Actually, nvm. I can just assemble the frame around it once it’s epoxied to the frame if it’s a problem

Ok, got the hinge jack working

It feels secure enough with the epoxy holding it in place, and it does still click into place since the right OEM hinge is there

The hinge is tight right now, but that’s because I milled out the hinge openings by hand with a rotary tool

Feels fine to me

The styrene tube I used was 7.9mm, so I considered using a 8mm drill bit, it would probably feel a little looser if I had done that

The jack placement is ok but not great, there are better placement options. So this is just a for fun mod
